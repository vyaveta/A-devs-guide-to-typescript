## Hellow, welcome to the github typescript manual created by Adwaith, My aim and inspiration to create this typescript manual is to help young / new developer to familiarize with typescript in an efficient way instead of depending on leatures and theory notes, learning typescript from this kind of code documentations will really help you to understand to its core and you will be able to use this knowledge to develope your dream project with typescript, and I am here  to help you with building your typescript fundamental / base 4

### You can clone this repository to you vscode or any code editor of your choice and play with it, make changes and figure out how things work, I will be providing notes and theory as comments to make you understand how things work

# Important Notice
### You need Javascript knowledge to learn Typescript, if you are not familiar with javascript, Learn JS first, Learning Typescript without learning Javascript is like trying to swin on the air instead of water
