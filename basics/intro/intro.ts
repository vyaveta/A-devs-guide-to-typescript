// lets start with some questions :)

// What really is typescript and what it does ?

/*
 Ans: Typescript is a developement tool, its a statically typed superset of Javascript, Typescript is build
upon the features of javascript and adds more features to it giving some super powers, 

For example => we can consider Naruto from the anime Naruto shippuden as Javascript and his Sage Mode as Typescript
Here Sage mode naruto is naruto himself but with extra powers such as more powerful chakra, sensing etc...

Just like that, we can call Typescript as an upgraded version of the Javascript which has more powers / abilities 
such os error checking,strictness and so on...

Typescript is a develepment tool to help you with developing your javascript application, by using typescript we
can reduce the bugs and typo errors, so its normally installed as a dev dependency => which means your application
will be running on javascript, we use typescript to make the development process easier
*/

/* Many of you might be thinking that how can typescript makes the developement process easier, this language is
pain in eyes and throw random error on random lines,

=> NO, its not if you know how to use it, but ofcourse Typescript do have learning curve and takes time to
learn but when you get to know how to use it to your advantage, you will face less errors and bugs in your 
application because typescript wont even let you type error and codes that has the slighties possibilites of 
causing bugs in the first place*/


// I recommend you to install ts-node to follow up with my code and documentations and use ts-node to run the ts files

// Go to variables.ts file in the intro folder
